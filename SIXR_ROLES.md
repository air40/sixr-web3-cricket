🏏 Diamond Batsman Role (Exclusive Recognition)

The Diamond Batsman is one of the most prestigious roles within the SIXR ecosystem. This recognition is not given to everyone — it is reserved for the select few who truly stand out in terms of contribution, dedication, and value creation.

What it Represents:

🔹 Priority – Access to exclusive perks within the SIXR ecosystem

🔹 Status – An elite mark of respect inside the community

🔹 Legacy – A title carried only by a handful of members who prove they belong
👉 Note: This role represents status, recognition, and influence across the entire ecosystem. Only a very limited number of members will ever achieve it.
